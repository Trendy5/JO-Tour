Downtown Amman is made up of a myriad of souq[2] markets and independently owned businesses. The area's long history leaves a large number of historical sites, such as the Amman Citadel with the Umayyad Palace, the Hashemite Plaza with the Roman Theatre and the Odeon, and the Roman Nymphaeum.`,

  There is a lot of thinking went into the design of the entrance... The stairs are used as a meeting point for people who are engaged or about to marry, they are writing their names on a lock and fixing it to the rails. Also the stairs are covered by Umbrellas which add warmth.
  
  It is really nice from inside, plenty of local artist paintings are shown on the walls. Calligraphy of well known phrases from poets and writers are shown on the walls as well... Makes you think.`,
